        <h1>Radburn N.J.</h1>
            <p>The town of Radburn N.J. was designed in the late 1920's, in anticipation of the completion of 
               the George Washington Bridge (e.g. G.W.B). The G.W.B. would link the suburbs of New Jersey, (one of them being Radburn N.J.)
               to the business centers in New York City (about 15-20 miles away). Being in Radburn is almost like stepping
               back in time. The forward thinking designs (circa late 1920's) remain a major part of Radburn today:</p>

                   there is natural common space that they cluster around:</p>

                <p class="myPadding">The underpass is a central part of the Radburn Parks. It connects the "A"
                   and "B" sections of Radburn. The walking path goes right under the street, so cars
                   are never an issue for pedestrians or cyclists. Please note this early underpass photo:</p>

                    <p class="myPadding">Radburn was designed with kids in mind. The purpose was to make pathways, parks, ball fields, 
                       swimming pools, and schools accessible without having to cross streets. Please note this
                       early photo of Radburn children at play. It is possible that several of these children
                       remain in town today, as well as their own children and grand children:</p>

             I miss this wonderful town but the fact of the matter is I now have strong roots in Tampa. 
             My wife enjoys the winter weather here, her friends, and her job. My kids have done
             great academically. My older daughter will be graduating FSU with a BFA degree,
             with approximately a 3.8 average. My younger daughter is a Freshman at UF and 
             hopes to become a doctor eventually.</p>
