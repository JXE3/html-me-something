        <h1>Radburn N.J.</h1>
            <p>The town of Radburn N.J. was designed in the late 1920's, in anticipation of the completion of 
               the George Washington Bridge (e.g. G.W.B). The G.W.B. would link the suburbs of New Jersey, (one of them being Radburn N.J.)
               to the business centers in New York City (about 15-20 miles away). Being in Radburn is almost like stepping
               back in time. The forward thinking designs (circa late 1920's) remain a major part of Radburn today:</p>

                <p>Nature is an integral part of the living space. Although individual homes have small lots (easier to maintain),
                   there is natural common space that they cluster around:</p>

                <p>The following is what greets you when you get off the highway, after a crowded, noisy, gritty day in

                <p>The underpass is a central part of the Radburn Parks. It connects the "A"
                   and "B" sections of Radburn. The walking path goes right under the street, so cars
                   are never an issue for pedestrians or cyclists. Please note this early underpass photo:</p>

                    <p>Radburn was designed with kids in mind. The purpose was to make pathways, parks, ball fields, 
                       swimming pools, and schools accessible without having to cross streets. Please note this
                       early photo of Radburn children at play. It is likely that several of these children
                       remain in town today, as well as their own children and grand children:</p>
